\chapter{Installing the necessary software}
We will be using lxc with zfs. Install the following
\begin{verbatim}
emerge zfs libvirtd lxc
\end{verbatim}
The kernel needs a lot of configuration. Enable the following flags in the kernel using the menuconfig:
\begin{verbatim}
cd /usr/src/linux
make menuconfig
flags to come
\end{verbatim}

\chapter{ZFS}
After installing zfs you will want it to start at boot. Do
\begin{verbatim}
rc-update add zfs default
\end{verbatim}
Using zfs is very easy. First add a new harddrive to your machine. Initialize it as a new zpool:
\begin{verbatim}
zpool create pool_name /dev/foo
\end{verbatim}
After that you can create volumes. Probably you will want one volume to be your master container from which all other containers are cloned:
\begin{verbatim}
zfs create pool_name/master
\end{verbatim}
Now do everything you need in order to create the master as described in \autoref{creating_master}. When you are done, take a snapshot of your master:
\begin{verbatim}
zfs snapshot pool_name/master@snapshot_name
\end{verbatim}
Creating clones is super easy:
\begin{verbatim}
zfs clone pool_name/master@snapshot_name pool_name/clone1
zfs clone pool_name/master@snapshot_name pool_name/clone2
zfs clone pool_name/master@snapshot_name pool_name/clone3
zfs clone pool_name/master@snapshot_name pool_name/clone4
zfs clone pool_name/master@snapshot_name pool_name/clone5
...
\end{verbatim}
The rest is done in virsh.
